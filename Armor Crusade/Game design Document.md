## General Description
2D Physics based top down fighting game. 
Game will contain a progression system and a focus on single player experience.


## Core ideas
Advanced difficulty level options - each difficulty level has multiple methods of modifying the challenge level.

Progression system - centers around risk management. Player fights endless waves of enemies with varying returns.
Between each round player will have to choose if he wants to return with all of his rewards or only a part of it in case he would die during next wave.

Non linear increase in power - player choice of equipment he decides to put on is limited by his pool of statistics.
Each piece of gear has a cost. Example: Player has 10 power, his sword costs 8 power, he cannot add his chainmail with cost of 3, so he opts to wearing a cloth armor with a cost of 1.
